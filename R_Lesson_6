Exercises:

Assume the purchases of shoppers in a store have been studied for a period of time and it is determined the daily purchases by individual shoppers are normally distributed with a mean of $81.14 and a standard deviation of $20.71. Find the following probabilities using R.
What is the probability that a randomly chosen shopper spend less than $75.00?
What proportion of shoppers spend more than $100.00?
What proportion of shoppers spend between $50.00 and $100.00?
Assume that the shopper’s purchases are normally distributed with a mean of $97.11 and a standard deviation of $39.46. Find the following scores using R.
What weight is the 90th Percentile of the shoppers’ purchases? That is, find the score P90 that separates the bottom 90% of shoppers’ purchases from the top 10%.
What is the median shoppers’ purchase? (Find the score P50 that separates the bottom 50% of shoppers’ purchases from the top 50%.) What is important about this number?
Generate a sample of size 50 from a normal distribution with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 4. What is the mean and standard error of the mean for the sample? Generate a second sample of size 50 from the same normal population. What is the mean and standard error of the mean for this second sample? Now repeat this process generating a sample of size 5000. Calculate the mean and standard error of the mean for this third sample and compare to the previous samples. What do you observe?

Assume a biased coin when flipped will generate heads one third of the time. Estimate the probability of getting at least 250 heads out of 600 flips using the normal distribution approximation. Compare to the exact probability using the binomial distribution.

Use the uniform distribution over 0 to 1. Generate three separate simple random samples of size n = 25, n = 100, n = 400. Plot histograms for each and comment on what you observe.

salaries.csvView in a new window gives the CEO age and salary for 60 small business firms. Construct QQ plots and histograms. Is the distribution of ages a normal distribution? Explain your answer.

# Solution for Lesson_6_Exercises_Using_R

# We use packages and functions in R whenever possible. 
# We build upon the foundation that R provides.
# The R environment includes more than five thousand packages,
# many written by the leading experts in statistics and data science.

# for the normal distribution we have the following functions
# dnorm(x, mean = 0, sd = 1, log = FALSE)  # density function
# pnorm(q, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)  # distribution function
# qnorm(p, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)  # quantiles
# rnorm(n, mean = 0, sd = 1)  # generate n normal random deviates

# 1) Assume the purchases of shoppers in a store have been studied 
# for a period of time # and it is determined the daily purchases 
# by individual shoppers are normally distributed with a mean of $81.14 
# and a standard deviation of $50.71. 
# Find the following probabilities using R.

# 1) a)	What is the probability that a randomly chosen shopper spend less than $75.00?
sprintf("%.4f", pnorm(75, mean = 81.14, sd = 20.71, lower.tail = TRUE))  

# 1) b) What proportion of shoppers spend more than $100.00? 
sprintf("%.4f", pnorm(100, mean = 81.14, sd = 20.71, lower.tail = FALSE))  

# 1) c) What proportion of shoppers spend between $50.00 and $80.00?
prob_greater_than_50 <- pnorm(50, mean = 81.14, sd = 20.71, lower.tail = FALSE)
prob_greater_than_80 <-pnorm(80, mean = 81.14, sd = 20.71, lower.tail = FALSE)
sprintf("%.4f", prob_greater_than_50 - prob_greater_than_80)  


# 2) Assume that the shopper's purchases are normally distributed 
# with a mean of $97.11 and a standard deviation of $39.46. 
# Find the following scores using R. 

# 2) a) What weight is the 90th Percentile of the shopper's purchases? 
# That is, find the score P90 that separates the bottom 90% of shopper's 
# purchases from the top 10%. 
sprintf("%.4f", qnorm(0.90, mean = 97.11, sd = 39.46, lower.tail = TRUE))  


# 2) b) What is the median shopper's purchase? 
# That is, find the score P50 that separates the bottom 50% of shopper's 
# purchases from the top 50%. What is important about this number?
sprintf("%.4f", qnorm(0.50, mean = 97.11, sd = 39.46, lower.tail = TRUE)) 

# What is important about this number?
# The normal distribution is symmetric, so its mean and median are identical.

# 3) Generate a sample of size 50 from a normal distribution with a mean 
# of 100 and a standard deviation of 4. What is the mean and standard error of the 
# mean for this sample? Generate a second sample of size 50 from the same normal 
# population. What is the mean and standard error of the mean for this second sample? 
# What can you say about the means and standard deviations of random samples 
# of the same size taken from the same population?  Now repeat this process 
# generating a sample of size 5000. Calculate the mean and standard error of 
# the mean for this third sample and compare to the previous samples. 
# What do you observe?

set.seed(1234)  # seed the random number generator for reproducibility
my_first_sample <- rnorm(n = 50, mean = 100, sd = 4)
std_error1 <- sd(my_first_sample)/sqrt(50)
cat("\nmy_first_sample mean: ", mean(my_first_sample), " std_error:", std_error1)

my_second_sample <- rnorm(n = 50, mean = 100, sd = 4)
std_error2 <- sd(my_second_sample)/sqrt(50)
cat("\nmy_second_sample mean: ", mean(my_second_sample)," std_error:", std_error2)

# What can you say about the means and standard deviations of random samples 
# They are close in value.

my_third_sample <- rnorm(n = 5000, mean = 100, sd = 4)
std_error3 <- sd(my_third_sample)/sqrt(5000)
cat("\nmy_third_sample mean: ", mean(my_third_sample), " std_error:", std_error3)

# Compare to the previous samples. What do you observe?
# Similar mean, smaller standard deviation. 
# Note that this relates to the standard error of the mean.


# 4) Assume a biased coin when flipped will generate heads one third of the time. 
# Estimate the probability of getting at least 250 heads out of 600 flips 
# using the normal distribution approximation. Then calculate the 
# exact probability using the binomial distribution. Compare the two probabilities.

# 250 heads out of 600 tosses implies a binomial with n = 600 and x = 250
# the biased coin has probability of heads p = 1/3

# normal approximation to the binomial uses  z = (x - n*p)/sqrt(n * p * (1-p))
n <- 600
p <- 1/3
x <- 250  # least 250 heads implies the upper tail of the standard normal distribution
z <- (x - n*p)/sqrt(n * p * (1-p))
sprintf("%.6f", pnorm(z, mean = 0, sd = 1, lower.tail = FALSE))

# R provides binomial probabilties directly
# dbinom(x, size, prob, log = FALSE)  # density function
# pbinom(q, size, prob, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)  # distribution function
# qbinom(p, size, prob, lower.tail = TRUE, log.p = FALSE)  # quantile function
# rbinom(n, size, prob)  # here n is the number of random variates to generate
sprintf("%.6f", pbinom(q = x, size = n, prob = p, lower.tail = FALSE))

# The normal approximation to the binomial is very close to the binomial.


# 5) Use the uniform distribution over 0 to 1. Generate three separate simple
# random samples of size n = 25, n = 100, n = 400. Plot histograms for each and
# comment on what you observe.
par(mfrow=c(1,3), oma=c(0,0,2,0))
hist(runif(25, min = 0, max = 1), main = "")
hist(runif(100, min = 0, max = 1), main = "")
hist(runif(400, min = 0, max = 1), main = "")
mtext("Histograms of uniform distribution (n = 25, 100 and 400)", side = 3,
	outer = T, line = -1)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))

# 6) Salaries.csv gives the CEO age and salary for 60 small business firms. 
# Use salaries.csv to answer the following questions: 

# 6) a) Is the distribution of ages a normal distribution? Explain your answer. 
# Let's begin by using exploratory data analysis, looking at the distribution.
# Make sure the comma-delimited text file <salaries.csv> is in your working directory.
salaries <- read.csv(file.path("c:/Rdata/","salaries.csv"))
print(str(salaries))  # examine the structure of the data frame
with(salaries, hist(AGE))
with(salaries, plot(density(AGE)))

# R provides qq plotting capabilities... see qqnorm documentation
# A straight line look to the plot suggests that the distribution
# is similar in form to a normal distribution.
qqnorm(salaries$AGE,main="AGE QQ",xlab="Normal Quantiles",ylab="Age Quantiles",datax=TRUE)
qqline(salaries$AGE,datax=TRUE,distribution=qnorm,probs=c(0.25,0.75),qtype=7)

# Each of these graphs implies that AGE may be thought of as normally distributed.
