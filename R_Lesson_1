Data set: home_prices.csvView in a new window

Description: This data file is derived from a random sample of home resale records maintained by realtors. There are 117 observations and eight variables:

PRICE = Selling price ($hundreds)
SQFT = Square feet of living space
YEAR = Year of construction (year)
BATHS = Number of bathrooms
FEATS = Number out of 11 features (dishwasher, refrigerator, microwave, disposal, washer, intercom, skylight(s), compactor, dryer, handicap fit, cable TV access)
NBR = Located in northeast sector of city (YES) or not (NO)
CORNER = Corner location (YES) or not (NO)
TAX = Annual taxes ($)
Exercises:

What are the measurement levels of each of the eight variables?
Should any variable have its values changed to better reflect its true nature?
For the variable PRICE, select a simple random sample of size 12 from the file. Save this sample in a vector named SRS. Print the values in SRS and compute the mean value. (For random sampling, see Lander pp.187-188, Stowell pp. 44 and Verzani pp. 219-220.)
For the variable PRICE, select a systematic sample of twelve observations. Start with the seventh observation and pick every 10th observation thereafter (i.e. 7, 17, 27,..). You should end with the 117th observation. Save the sample in a vector named SS. Print the values SRS and compute the mean value. (For systematic sampling, refer to page 283 of Lander for seq(from,to,by=) and Verzani pp. 28-29. Use this to define a vector of indices for selection.)
Examine the printed values and mean values obtained from the two sampling procedures. Do you see a difference? (Try the commands summary(SRS) and summary(SS).
Create boxplots for SRS and SS using boxplot(). How do the two samples compare?

# Solution for Lesson_1_Exercises_Using_R

# read the comma-delimited text file creating a data frame object in R

# R will treat most of the variables as numeric (or integer)

# note that the NBR and CORNER variables are character strings 
# default behavior of the read.csv() function will make these factor variables,
# with internal codes being NO = 1 and YES = 2 (not 0 and 1)

# create the data frame
houses <- read.csv(file.path("c://Rdata","home_prices.csv"))

# examine the structure of the data frame
str(houses)

# look at the first few records of the data frame
head(houses)

# look at the last few records of the data frame
tail(houses)

# look at descriptive statistics 
summary(houses)

# the questions for this assignment concern the variable PRICE
# so we will create a vector called PRICE and work with it
PRICE <- houses$PRICE

# for the variable PRICE, select a simple random sample of size 12

# prior to random sampling, seed the random number generator 
# so that results will be reproducible
set.seed(9999)

# use the sample() function to select a random sample of size 12
SRS <- sample(PRICE, 12)

# print the values of SRS and compute its mean
print(SRS)
mean(SRS)

# select a systematic sample of twelve observations. Start with the seventh
# observation and pick every 10th observation thereafter (i.e. 7, 17, 27,..)
SS <- PRICE[seq(from = 7, to = 117, by = 10)]

# check on the systematic sample
PRICE[7] == SS[1]
PRICE[17] == SS[2]
PRICE[27] == SS[3]
PRICE[117] == SS[12]

# print the values of SS and compute its mean
print(SS)
mean(SS)

# try the commands summary(SRS) and summary(SS)
summary(SRS)
summary(SS)

# box-and-whisker plot to compare SRS and SS
boxplot(SRS, SS, names = c("SRS", "SS"))
