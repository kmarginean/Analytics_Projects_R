Data Set: home_prices.csvView in a new window

Description: This data file is derived from a random sample of home resale records maintained by realtors. There are 117 observations and eight variables:

PRICE = Selling price ($hundreds)
SQFT = Square feet of living space
YEAR = Year of construction (year)
BATHS = Number of bathrooms
FEATS = Number out of 11 features (dishwasher, refrigerator, microwave, disposal, washer, intercom, skylight(s), compactor, dryer, handicap fit, cable TV access)
NBR = Located in northeast sector of city (YES) or not (NO)
CORNER = Corner location (YES) or not (NO)
TAX = Annual taxes ($)
Exercises:

For the following exercises use hist(), plot(), boxplot() and par() functions supplied by R.
Construct a histogram for PRICE. Describe the distribution shape.
Construct a histogram for TAX. Describe the distribution shape.
Construct a scatterplot displaying TAX versus PRICE. Is there a relationship?
Construct a stem-and-leaf plot for TAX using stem(). To aid in the interpretation of the plot, define X= TAX/100. Round X to one digit using round() and plot stem(X). Then try it directly on TAX and compare the results.
Use the par() and mfrow() or mfcol() functions to construct a window with two rows and one column showing the histograms for PRICE and TAX.
For the following exercises use hist() and, within hist(), breaks().
Construct a histogram for PRICE starting the first class at 1300 ($hundreds) with a class width of 600 ($hundreds).
Construct a histogram for TAX starting the first classat $500with a class width of $500.

# Solution for Lesson_2_Exercises_Using_R

# read the comma-delimited text file creating a data frame object in R
# as we did in Lesson 1, we create the data frame and examine it structure
houses <- read.csv(file.path("c:/Rdata/","home_prices.csv"))
str(houses)

# 1) a) Construct a histogram for PRICE. Describe the distribution shape.
hist(houses$PRICE)  # looks positively skewed, mean > mean
# or use with() function
with(houses, hist(PRICE))

# 1) b) Construct a histogram for TAX. Describe the distribution shape.
hist(houses$TAX)  # also looks positively skewed, mean > mean
# or use with() function
with(houses, hist(TAX))

# 1) c) Construct a scatterplot displaying TAX versus PRICE. Is there a relationship?
# here we put PRICE on the horizontal axis, TAX on vertical axis
with(houses, plot(PRICE, TAX))  # looks like a strong positive relationship

# 1) d) Construct a stem-and-leaf plot for TAX using stem()
# To aid in the interpretation, divide TAX by 100 and round to 1 digit.
# stem() will group the digits to the left of the decimal point, and
# list the numbers to the right of the decimal point to form the leaf.
# Then try it directly on TAX.  The result is the same.
X <- round(houses$TAX/100, digits=1)
stem(X)

# 1) e) Use the par() and mfrow() or mfcol() functions to construct a window
# with two rows and one column showing the histograms for PRICE and TAX.
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
with(houses, hist(PRICE))
with(houses, hist(TAX))
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
 

# 2) a) Construct a histogram for PRICE starting the first class at 1300 ($hundreds) 
# with a class width of 600 ($hundreds).
max(houses$PRICE) # this will let us know how many breaks we need  
with(houses, hist(PRICE, breaks = c(1300, 1900, 2500, 3100, 3700, 4300, 4900,
	5500)))

# 2) b) Construct a histogram for TAX starting the first classat $500with a class
#	width of $500.
max(houses$TAX)
with(houses, hist(TAX, breaks = c(500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000, 3500,
	4000, 4500)))
